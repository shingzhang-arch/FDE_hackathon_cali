# FDE Pulse: Deployment Strategist Weekly Update Process Survey

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this survey! Your feedback will help us understand the current process for submitting weekly customer updates in Slack and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and knowledge sharing.

**Purpose:** This survey gathers KPIs and business value metrics to strengthen the FDE Pulse use case—an AI agent designed to help Deployment Strategists with weekly updates and knowledge discovery.

**Time to complete:** Approximately 5 minutes

**Confidentiality:** Your responses will be used anonymously for analysis and to inform product development.

## Question 1: Time Investment

**On average, how much time do you spend writing and submitting your weekly customer update in Slack?**

- [ ] Less than 30 minutes
- [ ] 30-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-2 hours
- [ ] 2-3 hours
- [ ] More than 3 hours
- [ ] Other (please specify): _______________

**Why we're asking:** This helps us quantify the operational efficiency opportunity. If Deployment Strategists spend significant time on updates, we can calculate potential time savings.

## Question 2: Knowledge Discovery Frequency

**How often do you search for similar projects or solutions when starting a new engagement or facing a blocker?**

- [ ] Never
- [ ] Rarely (once a month)
- [ ] Sometimes (2-3 times per month)
- [ ] Often (weekly)
- [ ] Very often (multiple times per week)

**What methods do you currently use to find similar work? (Select all that apply)**

- [ ] Slack search
- [ ] Ask in team channels
- [ ] Browse documentation/wiki
- [ ] Ask colleagues directly
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Why we're asking:** Understanding search frequency and methods helps us identify demand for automatic knowledge surfacing and measure current process inefficiency.

## Question 3: Success Rate of Finding Relevant Work

**When you search for similar past work or solutions, approximately what percentage of the time do you find something relevant and useful?**

- [ ] 0-20%
- [ ] 21-40%
- [ ] 41-60%
- [ ] 61-80%
- [ ] 81-100%

**When you don't find relevant work, how much time do you typically spend searching before giving up?**

- [ ] Less than 15 minutes
- [ ] 15-30 minutes
- [ ] 30-60 minutes
- [ ] More than 1 hour

**Why we're asking:** Low success rates indicate wasted effort. This data helps quantify the value of FDE Pulse's automatic knowledge discovery capabilities.

## Question 4: Impact of Not Finding Similar Work

**When you can't find similar past work or solutions, what typically happens? (Select all that apply)**

- [ ] I spend extra time reinventing a solution
- [ ] Project timeline gets delayed
- [ ] I miss opportunities to leverage existing work
- [ ] I ask multiple people, taking their time
- [ ] I proceed without best practices
- [ ] Other: _______________

**On average, how much time do you estimate is wasted per month due to not finding relevant past work?**

- [ ] Less than 2 hours
- [ ] 2-5 hours
- [ ] 5-10 hours
- [ ] 10-20 hours
- [ ] More than 20 hours

**Why we're asking:** This quantifies the "cost of not knowing"—duplicate work, delays, and missed opportunities. This directly supports ROI calculations for FDE Pulse's knowledge archive feature.

## Question 5: Value Proposition Validation

**How valuable would each of these capabilities be to you? (Rate 1-5, where 1 = not valuable and 5 = extremely valuable)**

| Capability | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| An agent that helps you write weekly updates faster | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Automatic surfacing of similar projects when you need them (no searching required) | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Real-time knowledge of what other teams are working on that could help you | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Automatic summaries of solutions from past projects | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| A searchable archive of all past project learnings and solutions | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**What's the #1 pain point you'd want FDE Pulse to solve?**

_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

**Why we're asking:** This validates product-market fit and helps prioritize features. High scores across all capabilities indicate strong demand, and the open-ended question identifies the top pain point for messaging.

## Analysis Framework

After collecting responses, use this framework to extract key metrics:

### 1. Time Efficiency KPI
**Formula:** Average hours/week × Number of DS × 52 weeks = Annual hours spent

**Example calculation:**
- If average = 1.5 hours/week
- 20 Deployment Strategists
- 1.5 × 20 × 52 = 1,560 hours/year spent on weekly updates

### 2. Knowledge Discovery Efficiency
**Formula:** Search frequency × (1 - Success rate) = Wasted searches per month

**Example calculation:**
- If DS search "Often" (weekly) = 4 times/month
- Success rate = 40%
- 4 × (1 - 0.40) = 2.4 wasted searches/month per DS
- 2.4 × 20 DS = 48 wasted searches/month organization-wide

### 3. Cost of Knowledge Gaps
**Formula:** Average wasted hours/month × Number of DS = Total wasted effort

**Example calculation:**
- If average = 5 hours/month wasted
- 20 Deployment Strategists
- 5 × 20 = 100 hours/month = 1,200 hours/year wasted

### 4. ROI Opportunity
**Components:**
- Time saved on weekly updates (if reduced by 50%: 1,560 × 0.5 = 780 hours/year)
- Duplicate work avoided (from knowledge gaps: 1,200 hours/year)
- Faster project delivery (qualitative benefit)

**Total potential savings:** 780 + 1,200 = 1,980 hours/year

### 5. Feature Prioritization
**Calculate:** Average value score for each capability in Question 5

**Example:**
- If "Automatic surfacing" averages 4.8/5 → High priority
- If "Helps write updates" averages 3.5/5 → Medium priority
